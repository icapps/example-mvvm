# Login

This is an example application to show the implementation of the view model (also called MVVM) pattern.

We have some branches available that show you the different versions:

- **master** This contains the verbose `LoginViewController`.
- **view-model** This contains the `LoginViewController` with a simple view model integrated.
- **reactive-view-model** This contains the `LoginViewController` with a simple view model where we use the _reactive_ technology.
